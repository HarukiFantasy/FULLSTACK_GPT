What do you say to the people you meet who are on the third marriage, their kids don't talk to them, and there are certain things that they have convinced themselves, subconsciously or otherwise, maybe through an abusive upbringing or trauma, whatever it might be, that it is unsafe to feel certain things. And you come in, they've asked for help, but they do not want to open Pandora's box, right? They do not want someone to drag them into the deep waters of emotions that they've kept under lock and key for so long. How do you help someone like that? What do you suggest to them? Because it does get messy, right? It's gonna get messy before it gets clean, right? At least in my experience. It's like, oh, you're gonna do spring cleaning? Guess what? You got to take all the things that are up on the shelves, all the things in the drawers, all the things that are hanging on coat hangers, and you're gonna put them in the middle of the room. And it's gonna be a mess. It's gonna be a fucking mess. Yeah, and you're gonna be pissed that you did it. But you can't really get past go without that type of step. So for someone who's listening to this and says, you know what? I buy it. Like, I get it. And yet, what do I do? Because I've been, I've had on this armor for so long. So I would say a couple of things. I mean, the first thing I always feel like is really important to say is that I'm a researcher, and so I'm not a therapist. That would be differentiate me with Esther. Like, I don't see clients. If I go in and I'm working with CEOs, and this question comes up all the time, what I would say to people is, Pandora's box is closed right now. But are you under the impression that you're living outside of the box or in the box? Yeah, I like that. Yeah, I mean, like, you don't want to open Pandora's box, because that's strange to me, because you're living inside Pandora's box. And what I feel like you've asked me to come here to open it up. Like, we're not gonna do this process without walking through some deep shit, where there's gonna be deep, swift water. And if the water is super deep and swift, you need to go through that with a therapist and get that settled before we work in the organizational way. But what I would say to people, what I always say is, is the same for me, and I'm sure the same for you, that we all grew up and experienced to varying degrees, trauma, disappointment, how, you know, hard stuff, we armored up. And at some point, that armor no longer serves us. And so what I think I would say to that person is, how is not talking about this serving you? Like, I've been sober for 23 years. So someone in AA would be like, how's that shit working for you? You know, like, but I probably would put a softer spin on it than that. Over black coffee and a cigarette. But, you know, but I would say that it's not serving anymore. And now the weight of the armor is too heavy. And it's not protecting you, it's keeping you from being seen and known by others. And so this is, I mean, just tell you quintessentially, this is the developmental milestone of midlife. From late 30s to, you know, through probably your 60s. This is the question. Yeah, this is when the universe comes down and puts her hands on your shoulders and pulls you close and whispers in your ear. I'm not fucking around, you're halfway to dead. The armor is keeping you from growing into the gifts I've given you. That is not without penalty. Time is up. So this is what you see happen to people in midlife. And it's not a crisis. It's a slow, brutal unraveling. And this is where everything that we thought protected us keeps us from being the partners, the parents, the professionals, the people that we want to be. And I've only seen, this is a fork in the road, I've only seen two responses to this visit from the universe. Well, I guess there was my response, which I was like, screw you, bring it. Like you think you can best me? And then it was just one nightmare situation after another until, you know, you're not going to win that fight. I think if you say, you know what, I'm not, I'm not going to do it. Then you've got to double down. These are the people that walk through the world, double down on their own shit, in denial, you know, cheeks squeezed as they walk and cause so much pain in the world. Yeah. To themselves as well. I mean, yes, because it is so much easier to offload pain than to feel pain. And so you really have a choice in midlife, whether you're going to be, you're going to, you know, identify the first step of it, the whole process is what armor. And I'm not saying like, I'm not saying just pull off all the armor and streak through Austin, because I think you can't replace the armor with something. I think it's curiosity is what you replace it. You just become very curious about yourself, about the world. Why did I react that way? When Tim asked me that question, I wanted to like hit him over the head with a Topo Chico bottle. You know, what was going on there? Do you know what I mean? Like, what is my obsession about this? You just become very curious is curiosity is really the superpower for the second half of our lives. Because it keeps us learning, it keeps us asking questions and increases our self awareness. But when you see, and I think it's really hard, because, you know, I'll walk into a situation and they'll be the person who invited me is usually the CEO. And then you'll have like the cross armed, pissed off, clenched cheek, like F you look in person, usually in operations or technology, you know, and then they're like, what's the business case for you being here? Yeah, right. Like, because, you know, here's our stock price. Here's what's going on. Here's our valuation. Like, why? What do you need? And then, you know, the CEO usually say, fucking hate each other. And this can only last for so long. Like, you know, it's the end of every great band, right? Like, this is going to come to an end, and it's going to be terrible. And so, I don't know, I think you can't pull it all off at once. You have to, there's trauma for a lot of people, for all of us, there's trauma. Yeah. And people are like, no, there's not trauma for all of us. There's trauma for, you know, people who have been abused, physically, sexually, emotionally, there's trauma for people of color and people who have been on the margins. There's trauma for all of us. It's just different levels of trauma. Yeah. You know, I mean, to escape childhood with nothing is, I haven't met that person yet. No, I haven't either. Right. So, the trauma stuff, literally, the trauma message in our body is, you take this armor off, we die. So, you protect us at all costs and leave this on. A lot of that work has to be done with a therapist.
